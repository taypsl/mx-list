### Introduction

A throwback to the days of sharing of mix tapes, mx-list is a music blogging interface that enables users to easily create and share annotated playlists with friends and family. 

### Use Case

MX-List is a new blogging app for music enthusiasts who want to share more than just playlists. With an easy-to-use blogging interface, MX-list lets users create custom playlists that weave song information and personal commentary to create an immersive and contextual music experience they can share with others.

- Database integration and CRUD api was built with MongoDB and Mongoose
- EJS templating was used to render data to public pages
- User Authentication added with Passport.js

### Future Improvements
